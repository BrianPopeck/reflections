When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your project with other people or be able to efficiently work
    on one project from two different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually might be useful if you are using one local machine to work
    only on a particular set of features, so you don't need a copy of every branch locally.
    This might also make it easier to navigate a smaller local repository rather than the
    entire large repository.
